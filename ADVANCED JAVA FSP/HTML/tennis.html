    <h1>About Tennis</h1>
    <p>
      Tennis is a fast-paced individual or doubles sport played on various
      surfaces such as grass, clay, or hard courts. The game involves players
      using a racket to hit a ball over a net, aiming to land it within the
      opponent’s court boundaries in a way that makes it difficult for the
      opponent to return. Points are scored when the opponent fails to return
      the ball, and the player who wins the most sets takes the match. Tennis
      requires agility, precision, and mental focus, with prestigious
      tournaments like Wimbledon, the US Open, and the French Open showcasing
      the sport’s elite talents.
