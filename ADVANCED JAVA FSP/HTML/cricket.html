    <h1>About Cricket</h1>
    <p>
      Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams, each consisting
      of eleven players. Originating in England, it has become one of the most
      popular sports in countries like India, Australia, and South Africa. The
      game is played on a circular field with a pitch at its center, where the
      bowler delivers the ball to the batsman. The batsman's goal is to score
      runs by hitting the ball and running between wickets, while the opposing
      team tries to limit the runs and dismiss the batsmen through various
      methods. Cricket has multiple formats, from the five-day Test matches to
      the fast-paced Twenty20 games, each requiring a unique strategy and skill
      set.
